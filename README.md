# Cooperative Evidential Semantic Grid

## Introduction
This project use the 2 dimenssional bounding boxes from cameras of road side units (RSU) and on-board units (OBU) to generate an semantic occupancy map of a scene. We focused our work on situations at intersection and especially at round-abouts.
